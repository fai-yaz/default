# notes on Louis CK part

There is a part in a Louis CK standup where he claims 
> Out of any organised religion, Christians have won

which he follows up with
> Read the date, it is [Date] **after** Jesus' death...

but the actual thing would be that the Jews had won


Every year, it is to celebrate or mark the idea of Jesus' death,
1. Christians celebrate how their sins are going to be forgiven
1. normal people mark out their resolutions while eating the final chocolate from their calendars

but

**Jews** literally would have no problem, celebrating the Death they had caused

Surely they are winning instead - hidden from the rest of the world while everyone else tries to take the spotlight...

just an error or something missed out in his comedy part.
