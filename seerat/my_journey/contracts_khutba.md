# What is a contract? 
- hadith
- Quran

**idea**
> death -> prophet SAW death,
the contract of dying a muslim
the last moments in your head are to be dying as a muslim, 
life is the way forward
we inscrive our own actions, our own contractual obligations, 
like prayer, 
everything, the sound, the sight, the intention, these are all contracts
being written

more idea on the contract that Islam talks about, 
seeking truth, 
the contract with ourself, and with the Prophet SAW - that he will intercede
the promise is important and the one that we cannot corrupt ourselves on
