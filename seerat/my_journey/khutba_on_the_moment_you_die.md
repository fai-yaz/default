# Bismilla and opening Dua

ideas;
the story of the person doing good all his life, only to die a kafir

you only need one moment to die in a state you were bad in

you cannot let the idea that Allah is Al Ghafoor, Ar Raheem fool you, fool you into thinking your actions will make a change, only for you to unknowingly make the same mistake. this is hypocrisy of the heart. you feel it in yourself, when you make that same mistake, you are never supposed to make that mistake more than once. No Prophet did. yet people are. 

Allah says in the Quran how he hates those that repeats their sins, [check this]

those people [do more things and research about this and those people], 

yuo cannot let yourself live the life of a lie, 
if you are ashamed of committing sin, why are you ashamed, understand why you are ashamed. who is Allah? why are we alive? surely if we are committing the same error in our journey, we must have misunderstood something along the way. 

[what to do, Prophet SAW death and how we can end our day/begin]

I can offer one of many pieces of advice, 
go to bed as it is your death, and wake up as it is your last, 
[insert hadith or dhikr as well]

how are we truly making repentance,
